### Golang fundamentals
Code written when learning Golang with:
*"Master the fundamentals and advanced features of the Go Programming Language"*
interactive udemy course, by Stephen Grider.

### Contents
* 01_Hello: a "Hello, World!" program
* 02_Cards: multi-file go module implementing a deck of cards
* 03_ControlBlocks: if-else blocks, number ranges
* 04_Structs: structs, passing instances via pointers
* 05_Maps: maps' basics: declaring and passing maps around
* 06_Interfaces: basics of interfaces in Go
    * assignment: `triangle` and `square` structs sharing common `shape` interface
    * hard_assignment: use interfaces from `io` module to write a quine
        * note: for the quine to work, this program must be compiled first (`go build main.go`),
        then executed as `./main main.go`. For convenience, a plain text file
        has been used during development.
