# Toolbox

I'm learning Golang here by writing a reusable Go module.

The module provides the following utilities:

- [ ] Read JSON
- [ ] Write JSON
- [ ] Generate a JSON-encoded error response
- [x] Upload a file to a preset directory
- [ ] Download a static file
- [x] Get a random string of requested length
- [ ] Post a JSON payload to a remote service
- [ ] Create a directory, including all parent directories
- [ ] Create a URL-safe slug from a string

Based on "Building a module in Go (Golang)" course by Trevor Sawler:
